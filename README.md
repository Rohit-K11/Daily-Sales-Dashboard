# Daily-Sales-Dashboard
The project involved creating a Daily Sales Report (DSR) using Microsoft Power BI. The initial step was to extract and consolidate data from multiple PDF files using Power Query. After applying the necessary transformations, a visual report was created. The report provides a summary of daily sales for the business, allowing decision-makers to monitor and analyze sales trends. Overall, the project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to create insightful reports using data from disparate sources.
